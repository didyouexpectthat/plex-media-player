NEW:
  - (Embedded) The embedded distribution is now based on LibreELEC instead of OpenELEC.
    Embedded users will have to do a clean install because of this change. AutoUpdate is
    disabled.
  - (Embedded) Moved to a EFI bootloader - Some BIOS's may need enabling of EFI to find the install media
  - (Embedded) Skylake support
  - (Embedded) NVIDIA legacy build is deprecated and incorporated into the Generic build
  - Improved hardware decoding on Windows and x86 Embedded.
  - Qt bumped to version 5.6.1
  - There has been some changes how PMP is built on Windows and OSX. We no longer bundle
    ffmpeg and mpv with the build system and you need to download and install them yourself.
    This only applies to people that build PMP by themself 
  
FIXED:
  - There was an issue where the web-client and the playback engine could get out of state
    and cause screensaver to show up during movies or not let you press play/pause. This is
    now fixed.
  - Non US locales could create problems with playback on Linux
  - CEC keyhandling is now back to the default (no auto-repeat) beacuse of many incompatiblities.
    If you have a CEC device that gives you press and release events you can enable autorepeat
    by editing the configuration file.
  - PMP should now install correctly on Windows 10N
  - PMP can now be built with Qt 5.7
  - PMP should no longer prevent sleeping on OSX / Windows
  - Screensaver should be smooth again
